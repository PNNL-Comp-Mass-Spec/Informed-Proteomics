# Informed Proteomics

The Informed Proteomics project includes algorithms for proteomic mass spectrometry data analysis. Although the back-end data access and some of the scoring routines are general purpose, this repository is currently maintained for top down MS/MS datasets.

## MSPathFinderT

MSPathFinder finds peptides in top-down LC-MS/MS datasets. Similar to database search engines for bottom-up, it takes a fasta file, a spectrum file, and a list of modifications as an input and reports proteoform spectrum matches (PsSMs) and their scores. These results are output in a tab-separated format and in a MzIdentML file.

Processing steps:

1. Run PbfGen.exe to convert the instrument file or .mzML file to an optimized binary file
  * Creates a .pbf file
    This file contains spectra information and full chromatograms for MS1 and MSn data, allowing fast access to extracted ion chromatograms during the search.
  * This step usually only needs to be performed once for a dataset, and by default will do nothing if it has previously been run on the dataset and can find the file.
  * ProMex and MSPathFinderT will perform this step automatically if they are given a spectrum file that is not a .pbf file.

2. Run ProMex on the .Pbf file to deisotope the data, including determine charge states
  * Creates a .ms1ft file
  * This file can be reused for multiple searches, as long as none of its parameters change
  * MSPathFinderT will perform this step automatically if not provided with a path to a feature file, using the respective parameters from the MSPathFinderT parameters.

3. Run MSPathfinderT with the .Pbf (or .raw) file and a fasta file to search for proteins
  * Creates \_IcTda.tsv files and .mzid
  * Can also be run with the spectrum source file directly, with PbfGen and ProMex run as part of the process.

Example command lines:

`PbfGen.exe -s MyDataset.raw`

`ProMex.exe -i MyDataset.pbf  -minCharge 2 -maxCharge 60 -minMass 3000 -maxMass 50000 -score n -csv n -maxThreads 0`

`MSPathFinderT.exe  -s MyDataset.pbf -feature MyDataset.ms1ft -d C:\FASTA\ProteinList.fasta -o C:\WorkFolder -t 10 -f 10 -m 1 -tda 1 -minLength 21 -maxLength 300 -minCharge 2 -maxCharge 30 -minFragCharge 1 -maxFragCharge 15 -minMass 3000 -maxMass 50000 -mod MSPathFinder_Mods.txt`

### Results viewer / GUI
For viewing search results, you might want to consider [LCMS-Spectator](https://github.com/PNNL-Comp-Mass-Spec/LCMS-Spectator). It can also function as a GUI for running ProMex and MSPathFinder.

                         or ';' will be treated as comments; blank lines are
                         ignored. Lines that start with text that does not match a
                         parameter will also be ignored.

  -CreateParamFile       Create an example parameter file. Can supply a path; if
                         path is not supplied, the example parameter file content
                         will output to the console.

  NOTE:                  arg#1, arg#2, etc. refer to positional arguments, used
                         like "AppName.exe [arg#1] [arg#2] [other args]".

```

Enabling tag-based searching with `-tagSearch 1` can give 5% to 10% more matches, but can increase the runtime by 30% to 50%.

### Supported file formats

These programs, when used with no other software installed, only support the use of centroid mzML files as spectrum input.

Versions prior to February 1, 2019: If Thermo Finnigan MSFileReader is installed, it also supports reading from Thermo Finnigan .raw files ([Download here](https://thermo.flexnetoperations.com/control/thmo/download?element=6306677), requires registration to download).

Versions after February 1, 2019: If running as a 64-bit program, reading from Thermo Finnigan .raw files is supported via the included RawFileReader dlls (no additional software install required).

Several other formats are supported if an appropriate version of ProteoWizard is installed ([Download here](http://proteowizard.sourceforge.net/downloads.shtml), make sure the version downloaded matches system architecture)
